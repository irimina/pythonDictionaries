Testing the menu
In this lesson we will test the program more thoroughly,
and add some better comments to the code.

Because our code has functions, we need to test that each one runs properly
by testing the menu with expected, boundary (if any) and invalid values.

CREATE
Click RUN and test the name input with an expected value e.g. Bob.
Test the name input again with a lower case name to check if .title() works
(boundary value).
Test the option input with the 4 expected values: 1, 2, 3 and 4.
There are not really any boundary values for the menu itself, so now test it
with a couple of invalid values for options.
TIPS

Note: When testing a program, it's really important to think like your users,
and imagine the worst case scenarios - what mistakes are your users most
likely to make? If you plan your program carefully, and test it thoroughly,
then your users should be able to recover well even if they make mistakes.
