In this lesson we are going to work through an example program that will translate words from English to Maori. 
In this code we will use both a dictionary and functions.

The next lesson will step through some testing and some advice for commenting your code.

Let's get started by building the dictionary and writing the first function.


Word List:

apple: aporo
chair: turu
pen: pene
hello: kia ora
goodbye: ka kite
Menu Text:
